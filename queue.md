# Wonderful Queue

## Questions

10.1. You can access elements in the array quicker since it is contiguous in memory.
Essentially, with arrays there is fast random access.

10.2. The implementation is flexible in that we don't need to know about the queue size
ahead of time since the linked list frows dynamically. Thus, enqueuing and dequeuing is easier because you
know where there is an empty space in memory that you can add a node.

10.3. It will be easier for the developer to write so time is saved in creating
the program.

10.4. The queue will be faster due to the low-level nature of C outperforming
higher level languages.

10.5. enqueue: q.enqueue(s)
      dequeue: q.dequeue()
