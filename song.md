# Song that Never Ends

## Questions

8.1. You see a recursion error eventually, which indicates that the maximum
recursion depth exceeded while calling a python object.

8.2. See `song.c`.

8.3. I get a segmentation fault after a waiting a long time.

8.4. A segmentation fault occurs when the call stack has too much memory used up. This is
due to too many levels of recursion. It is essentially caused by having too much/deep-recursion.

8.5. See `song.py`.

8.6. The problem was recursive in that it got increasingly smaller and those smaller versions
were more easily solvable. Recursive algorthim, by definition, takes smaller input values and applies simple operations to
return a smaller input.
