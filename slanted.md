# Complementary Questions

## Questions

7.1. It means that it is difficult to decrypt. So an easy cipher that is less
secure would be to just change each letter by one. A more secure one would change
the message in a more complex manner.

7.2. The decrypter can notice the frequency or pattern in the words. They
can quickly notice the regularity of the solution. Most importantly, the cipher
would only be able to use 26 different keys, so brute fore attacks would be very effective
because attackers could go through each key and backtrack to what the message would be if
that key was used.

7.3. Because transposition doesn't change the frequency of individual letters, frequency
counts of the letters could be used to crack the cipher. There is also relatively simple way
of cracking it called anagramming, where the attacker looks for parts of the message that
look like anagrams of words and solves those anagrams.

7.4. That n could end up being a small number like 1 or 2, so that the ciphered text would
reveal long sections of legible plaintext interspersed by the copher text.

7.5. Hashing a message is just securing it for the user. Whereas, encrypting a message implies that
the message will be sent to someone else for the purpose of being understood by that specific person.
Hashing a message simply takes the message and stores it away without any desire to transmit it elsewhere.

7.6. See `slanted.py`.
