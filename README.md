Our project has two main features based on classes the user inputs:
    1. Matching individuals with a best fit concentration
    2. Matching blocking groups with a best fit concentration
The user starts off on the home page of the website where he/she is greeted with a message and a button to sign up. The user must
sign up and register an account in order to use the program. Once the user has logged in he/she will be taken to a different home page
that has the two features marked by two buttons: "Match Yourself" and "Match Your Blocking Group". These links take the user to the respective
pages.

The program runs in the IDE. You must have the entire CMatch folder downloaded to your IDE and then run flask to get the webserver for the website.
Then, simply click the buttons and links on the webpage to navigate the program.

During user registration, he or she cannot make a duplicate account and thus cannot register usernames that are already registered. Also on the
registration page is a link that guides a user that is already registered to the login page.

For the "Match Yourself" feature, users input 12 courses for themselves and then click on match. After that they are guided to a different page
with their matched conentration and a link to the student handbook, where they can explore the different concentrations and see what requirements
there are for their matched concentration and others.

For the "Match Your Blocking Group" feature, users input 4 courses for each of their blockmates (up to 8) and then click on match. The user is then
also referenced to another page that displays the concentration that their blocking group got matched with and a link to the student handbook for the
same reason as above.

The user can play around with each feature multiple times by simply clicking on the CMatch logo on the navbar and being directed to the home page and then
clicking on one of the two options again. Or by looking at the navbar and clicking on "Match" or "Blocking".

When the user is finished playing around with the program, they can log out by clicking on the button on the top right of the page. When they revisit the website
they can click on login at the top right of the page and enter their registed account information to enter the program again.
