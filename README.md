# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Concentration Crisis

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

Students input the classes that they have taken and the program matches them up with a concentration that they should have declared.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

We will take all of the reccomended classes on the harvard handbook and assign them values for each concentration. Our software will go through each input
of the student and give points to the classes. For example, cs50 would get 1 point for math and 3 for cs. Then, the program would add points up and whatever conentration
had the most points would be the student's recommended concentration. This program's goal would be to let the user know if their conentration was actually
a right choice for them or not.

## If planning to combine CS50's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to CS50, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

N/A

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

A good outcome would be to have a working program that matches users up with their concentration.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

It saves your info and you can take it multiple times and you can compare your concentration rating to other users.
For example, if one person accumulates more "CS points", then that person is more of a CS

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Interface with the my.harvard.edu website and during real time have the courses that the user selects accumulate points on his screen to
show them their prospective concentration.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

1. Go through handbook and make an excel sheet (Julia)
2. Make a user log in page (Zergham)
3. Make a student input page that allows users to select how many classes they have taken currently (Julia)
4. Compare courses with courses in excel sheet (Work together)
5. Decide best fit concentration, output concentration name (Zergham)
6. Bonus: allow user to compare with others (work together)

We Know what to do mostly and we know the skills. But will ask if we need help.
