1.3. It might become negative due to overflow, which is when the number
we are trying to store is too large for the space allocated for it.
In this case, if the number is greater than a 32-bit integer, it would overflow.

1.4. The computer only had amount of space for that number of digits, so the computer
ran out of bits as the 1 was carried over as a 33rd 1. So, the maximum 32-bit number had
its highest place number carry over and overflow to 0.

1.5. A number in the software required 64-bits to express and the engineers wanted to turn
that into a 16-bit number and thought that most of the digits in the 64-bit number was 0, so there
was integer overflow. This number had represented the acceleration, which was faster but the
software didn't account for that.
