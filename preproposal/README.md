# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

We plan to implement a program that pairs students up with a concentration based on the classes you've taken. One possible strategy we came up with was
to use a data structure with each concentration and put classes from the student handbook in them. Then, assign a value to each class based on what subject
we think it matches up with most. For example, if a student takes CS124 then they would get a value for CS and Math as concentrations, but the "CS value" would
be more. So, in the end, the student would be assigned the concentration that they have accumulated the most "points" for.

## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names, and who are their section leaders?

Julia Huesa, TF = Wesley De Silvestro

## Do you have any questions of your own?

Nope
