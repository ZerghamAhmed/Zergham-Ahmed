# Memes

## Questions

5.1. The three fields would be username, comment, and time(which would be timestamp).


5.2. They could have a separate table that has stores the fields original commenter's ID, the replier's ID and message/replies.
Or even better than that you can break the table into two. One with messages and one with replies and then connect them based on a characteristic
such as the original commentor's id. For each table you can also have a timestamp field.

5.3. See `memes.html`.
