Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

We created the website and the login page, but the database is not working for our users. We have to fix the bug in it. We created a spreadsheet of all the classes.

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

We have not done any of the coding that compares concentrations by adding points etc. We need to create an input page. Need to write code that compares two users. Need to have the program input concentration
match and add a link to that department's website.

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

A lot of bugs in the html code. A lot of overlap in classes so need to decide on how to assign points. A lot of classes for some departments, while others have less
Account for that disparity by adding more subjective course options like "a course that discusses Renaissance art" that can count for concentrations that
do not have as many gateway, popular courses like CS50, LS1a, Math 1a, etc.
