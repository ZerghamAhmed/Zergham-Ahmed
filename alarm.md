# False Alarm

## Questions

2.1. There should be contrast between the drill and the actual PACOM message because both are in all capital letters
and look the similar at quick glance. For example, the drill could be in lowercase, whereas
the actual message could be in all caps.

2.2. I feel like you could argue it both ways, but the UI should have definately accounted
for human error and should have been responsive. So, it should have had a confirmation button that
made sure when the user clicked the option, it would ask them for confirmation to proceed.

2.3a. With HTML, I would have make the options buttons (the actual alarm with a larger button to caution the user), which would be linked with Javascript code.

2.3b. Using the confirm() method in Javascript to display a confirm box when the user clicks one of the options.

2.3c. With CSS, I would change the font size or color of the buttons to have the actual alert with a cautionary color like red while the drill with blue, etc.


2.4. You can use this as a backup in that you can use SQL's trigger procedure, which would execute after the user tried to input information in your program.
You could use this by having the user enter in a passcode to confirm whether they want to execute the actual alarm, preventing anyone without proper authorization
from sending the actual alert.

2.5. They could have a seizure accidently click on the actual alarm and the confirm button. Or the user could be really intoxicated
and type the key word in the confirmation box.
